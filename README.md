# e-dressing-room

The e-dressing Room is a **virtual dressing room** which enables users to try on clothes
virtually rather than physically, allowing not to put on the clothes they want to try. This
product targets private users. Indeed, with a computer and a Kinect, they will be able to try on
clothes from an online catalogue at home.
